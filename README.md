# pokemon_analysis
This repository contains my pokemon data analysis project

# Purpose
As I recently finished a python data analysis course and found my old pokemon black 2 game, I decided to work on some pokemon data since I thought it would be fun. The dataset included information such as the pokemon name, type, mega evolution, the 6 stats that all pokemon have and whether they are a legendary.

# Tools used
Pandas was used for data cleaning, aggregation and analysis
Maplotlib and seaborn were used for the visualizations
